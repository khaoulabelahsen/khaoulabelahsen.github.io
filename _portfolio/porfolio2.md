InClass Kaggle Competition for french web domain classification. This was my final project for the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) course "[Advanced Learning for Text and Graph Data](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/contenus-/advanced-learning-for-text-and-graph-data-239506.kjsp?RH=1242430202531)" (teached by Michalis Vazirgiannis).

The dataset of French domains was generated from a large crawl of the French web that was performed by the DaSciM team at [Ecole Polytechnique](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/) and was composed of both Text and Graph Data.

The details of our approach is described in the [report](https://khaoulabelahsen.github.io/files/altegrad_report.pdf).

You can find the [final report](https://khaoulabelahsen.github.io/files/altegrad_report.pdf) for this project and the Python [source code](https://github.com/khaoulabelahsen/French-Web-Domain-Classification) which provide further details about this project.
