# About Me

I am a graduate student from Paris, France.

I obtained a BS in Engineering from [ENSTA Paris](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr/fr) and currently working towards a MS in Applied Mathematics from [ENSTA Paris](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr/fr) and an MS in [Mathematics, Vision and Learning](https://www.master-mva.com/) from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

I was a research intern with Dr Celia MT Greenwood  in the [Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health](https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/) at Mcgill University and [The Lady Davis Institute](http://www.ladydavis.ca/en/celiagreenwood) researching High-Dimensional non linear interactions between gene and environment data and their effect on the development of Child Obesity. 

Starting Mid-June 2020, I will be joining the Data Science team at <a href="https://kayrros.com"> Kayrros.</a> for a 6 months internship as a Junior Data Scientist.
