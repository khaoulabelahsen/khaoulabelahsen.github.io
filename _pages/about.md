# About Me

I'm a 22 years old graduate student at ENSTA Paris and ENS Paris-Saclay, pursuing the MVA Master. I obtained a bachelor of Science in Engineering from ENSTA Paris and currently working towards a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics from ENSTA Paris and the MVA Master of Science in Machine Learning and Computer Vision from ENS Paris-Saclay. 
Last year, I was a research intern at McGill University and The Lady Davis Institute researching Machine Learning applications to Epidemiology. Starting Mid-June 2020, I will be joining the Data Science team at <a href="https://kayrros.com"> Kayrros.</a> for a 6 months internship as a Junior Data Scientist.
